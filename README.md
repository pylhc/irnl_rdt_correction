Performs local correction of the Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs)
in the Insertion Regions (IRs) based on the principle described in
[[1]](#1) with the addition of correcting
feed-down and using feed-down to correct lower order RDTs.
Details can be found in [[2]](#2).


## Documentation

- The note containing background, derivation and implementation details can be found in the attached [note](latex/note.pdf).
- Autogenerated docs via `Sphinx` can be found at <https://pylhc.github.io/irnl_rdt_correction/>.

## Installing

This package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, and can be installed through `pip`:
```bash
python -m pip install irnl-rdt-correction
```

After installing, scripts can be run with either `python -m irnl_rdt_correction --FLAG ARGUMENT` or by calling the Python files directly.

For development purposes, we recommend creating a new virtual environment and installing from VCS in editable mode with all extra dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pylhc/irnl_rdt_correction
python -m pip install --editable "irnl_rdt_correction[all]"
```

## Main Script 

-  [**irnl_rdt_correction.py**](irnl_rdt_correction/main.py) - Script to compute RDT correction in the (HL)LHC IRs including feed-down effects.
