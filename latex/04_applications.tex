\section{Applications}

The new correction package has already been extensively used for studies of the LHC and HL-LHC optics.
The influence of feed-down has been studied in~\cite{DillyCorrectionsFeedDownNonLinear2021},
while  the  correctability  of asymmetric optics has been investigated in~\cite{DillyCorrectionsAsymmetricNonLinear2021}.
In another study, the feasibility to correct systematic normal decapole errors in the separation and 
recombination dipoles of the HL-LHC~\cite{DillyFeasibilityCorrectingSystematic2021,DillyCorrectionsSystematicNormal2022} has been tested.
The ease of use and availability allows to utilize the new package with little effort in future studies of non-linear IR corrections.

The algorithm has been received with interest and additional features have been suggested.
Among these is the inclusion of the phase-advance between elements, 
to further approach (and correct) the exact value of the RDT, 
instead of the \textit{effective} RDTs targeted in the current implementation, which has already been inlcuded into the \textit{``To Do''} of \cref{sec:Todo} in this note.
