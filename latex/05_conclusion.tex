\section{Conclusion}

An improved algorithm to correct nonlinear errors by locally compensating effective RDTs in the IRs has been derived and implemented, 
overcoming the rigidness of previous implementations and giving the user more control over the correction.
Its main features include the option to target arbitrary RDTs, include more than one beam optics,
and either include feed-down into the RDTs to be corrected, 
or using the feed-down from the corrector magnets themselves for compensation.

This note is meant to be a supplement documentation to the code found at~\cite{OMC-TeamIRNLRDTCorrection}
changes in this pdf should be reflected in the repository and vice-versa.
